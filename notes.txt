QCC: 
    - Are we actually sorting anything, if the items are always put in the right place?
Disco: 
- When we created OrderedArrayList's add method, we used the boolean return type to end loops and skip parts of code
    - This was unplanned. We just wanted to match ArrayList's add method, which has a boolean return type
- ArrayList already has a toString() method that prints a visual representation of the arrray
